            About Me
        </h1>
        <p>
            I am a Designer, Developer and Open Data
            Enthusiast. I have experience programming
            web pages with Javascript frameworks like
            React, also I like the interface design in
            which I use Figma and TailwindCSS to make
            them intuitive and stylized. I am very
            interested in Data Science and Engineering
            so I use Python as my tool from web
            scraping to data analysis..
